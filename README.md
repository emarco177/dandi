Dandi API is a comprehensive boilerplate repository for building AI-powered micro SaaS applications. It provides a solid foundation with essential components and functionalities needed to run an end-to-end micro SaaS application.

The service itself offers powerful insights, summaries, and analytics for open source GitHub repositories.

**🌐 Live Application: [https://www.dandi.cloud/](https://www.dandi.cloud/)**



## 🚀 Key Features

- **Complete Micro SaaS Structure**: Implements all necessary components for a fully functional AI micro SaaS application.
- **API Key Management**: Built-in system for handling API keys, UI heavily inspired by [Tavily](https://www.tavily.com/).
- **Rate Limiting**: Integrated rate limiting for API protection.
- **SSO Login**: Implemented Single Sign-On functionality.
- **AI Integration**: Leverages LangChain JS for AI capabilities.

## 🛠️ Built with Cursor IDE and v0

This entire project was developed using [Cursor IDE](https://cursor.com/), primarily through prompting with Cursor Composer and [v0](https://v0.dev/) . As a developer without frontend or full-stack experience, this project demonstrates the power of AI-assisted development.

**ENGLISH IS THE NEW PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE.**
